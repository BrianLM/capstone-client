# The Application

Enter world of Enotspac in this game. Explore through the deserts, mountains, plains and forests as you improve your creature to be able to take on stronger challenges.

## The tech

This game was created with Angular 2 CLI for the front end. Bootstrap styling is used for displaying as well as custom CSS. HTML is used for page components. Functionality is extended from Ng classes as well as custom coding.

## With the user in mind
- 'As a user I can sign up to log in from anywhere to play.'
- 'As a user my game state is unique to me.'
- 'As a user I can see my progress through the game.'
- 'As a user I can take on stronger challenges and get stronger.'

## The planning
### The start
Planning for the site started with defining the desired features, and which would be needed first to be functional. After defining the features, the page design was planned and scaffolded.
### The back end
Backend development started with a User Profile to tie user resources together. The backend resources were created. Once the backend resources were available, the front end was tied to the respected resources and troubleshot.

Once logging in was available, creating lists and items were next. Each of these entities are stand-alone resources, meaning they do not require any other entities, and extend others by their presense.

Basic gameplay is present, however there is a great deal of available development.

## Future development
The ERD is configured to handle a great deal more functionality. Additional features would include
1. Getting Jobs at the Farm. Jobs will allow the user to obtain additional skill points
2. The Parts engine. Parts will add stats based on what type of part.
3. Items. Items will be used in increasing Parts strength. Parts and resources will be shown.
